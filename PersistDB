Start an ubuntu container that will create a file named /data.txt with a random number between 1 and 10000.

 docker run -d ubuntu bash -c "shuf -i 1-10000 -n 1 -o /data.txt && tail -f /dev/null"
In case you’re curious about the command, we’re starting a bash shell and invoking two commands (why we have the &&). The first portion picks a single random number and writes it to /data.txt. The second command is simply watching a file to keep the container running.

Validate that we can see the output by execing into the container. To do so, open the Dashboard and click the first action of the container that is running the ubuntu image.
